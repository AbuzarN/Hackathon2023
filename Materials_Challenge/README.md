# Improving the Outdoor Enclosure
## Overview
To provide fiber Internet service, Frontier must place equipment at your home. This requires several pieces of equipment:
- An enclosure (typically made of plastic) that has multiple locations to mount the ONT, power supply, and carefully route cables
- An ONT which is an electronic device that converts optical signals into electrical signals (Ethernet, WiFi, Coaxial cable, etc.)
- A power supply
- Various cables connecting the equipment to our network and to your home

Enclosures (and the equipment inside them) are made to undergo significant stress and environmental factors. This includes:
- Direct sunlight (and UV radiation)
- High ambient temperatures (up to 140°F)
- Low ambient temperatures (down to -40°F)
- Significant temperature swings (from morning to evening)
- Rain, snow, sleet, hail, fog
- Rodents and insects
- Physical damage (gardeners, construction, etc.)
## Challenge
Your challenge is to improve in any way you can the enclosure that houses our equipment but with special attention to reducing the internal temperature
